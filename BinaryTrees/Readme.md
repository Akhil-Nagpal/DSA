# Binary Tree Data Structure In Javascript

A binary tree is a type of data structure where every node can have a maximum of two children, known as the left and right children. Application of binary tree structures includes sorting, searching, and representing data hierarchically.

### Key Concepts

&#10687; **Node** &#8227; A basic unit of a binary tree that contains a value or data as well as pointers to its left and right descendants.

&#10687; **Root** &#8227; The tree's highest node, which is without parents.

&#10687; **Leaf** &#8227; A node with no childrens.

&#10687; **SubTree** &#8227; A tree made out of every child node on a node.

&#10687; **Height** &#8227; The maximum distance that a root can travel before reaching a leaf.

&#10687; **Depth** &#8227; The path length between a root and a node.

### Types Of Binary Trees

&#10687; **Full Binary Tree** &#8227; Each node has either 0 or 2 children.

&#10687; **Complete Binary Tree** &#8227; All levels, except possibly the last, are fully filled, and all nodes are as left as possible.

&#10687; **Perfect Binary Tree** &#8227; Every internal node has two childrenÂ exactly, and every leaf node is at the same level.

&#10687; **Balanced Binary Tree** &#8227; Any given node's left and right subtrees differ in height by a maximum of one.

&#10687; **Binary Search Tree (BST)** &#8227; A binary tree that allows for efficient searches is called a Binary Search Tree (BST), in which the children on the left are smaller than the node and the children on the right are larger.

## Binary Search Tree in Brief

**_Binary Search Tree (BST)_** is a tree-like data structure with a single root at the very top. They are a great way to store numeric values as their ordered nature allows for fast search and lookups.

### Compared to a normal tree, Binary Search Tree has the following properties :-

&#10687; Every left child has a smaller value than its parent.

&#10687; Every right child has a larger value than its parent

&#10687; Every node can contain from 0 to 2 children.

### Applications of Binary Search Trees

&#10687; **Searching** &#8227; BSTs allow for efficient search operations.

&#10687; **Sorting** &#8227; In-order traversal of a BST provides a sorted sequence of elements.

&#10687; **Hierarchical Data Representation** &#8227; Hierarchical data structures, such as file systems and organizational hierarchies, are represented as binary trees.

&#10687; **Expression Trees** &#8227; Used in syntax tree parsing and expression representation in compilers.
